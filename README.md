# AutoXL

AutoXL is a fundamental and powerful library of Excel functions written in Excel formula language.

<!-- # Demo -->

<!-- Design principle:
- not too many functions
- rely on derived names rather than optional arguments, because we aim to benefit end-users -->

## Installation

You could use Formula Editor to add the library to your workbook. It always proposes the latest stable version of AutoXL.

To remove the library, at the moment, you could go to "Name Manager" and manually delete all the functions starting with `A.` (make sure that you don't have other user-defined functions or ranged names starting with `A.`).
